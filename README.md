The project is to compute the HOG (Histograms of Oriented Gradients) feature from an input image and then classify the HOG feature vector into human or no-human by using a 3-nearest neighbor (NN) classifier.

In the 3-NN classifier, the distance between the input image and each of the images in a sample database is computed and the classification of the input is taken to be the majority classification of the three nearest neighbors.
